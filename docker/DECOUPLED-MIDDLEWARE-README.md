# Supabase Docker

This is a minimal Docker Compose setup for self-hosting Supabase with decoupled postgresql databsae component.
The Database components are still using supabase/postgres docker image as per original dockerized supabase stack but without being integrated within the same docker compose stack. Follow the steps [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/hosting/docker) as reference where necessary.
